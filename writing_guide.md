# :thought_balloon: Determining a Topic

Three simple steps when stuck on ideas:

1. Start with your reader.

    - What problems does your reader experience?
    - What questions are they asking? 

<br/>

2. Jot a list of everything that comes to mind.

</br>

3. Pick and Google one of these problems and take note of the top three search results.
    - How have these search results phrased the problem?
    - How are they solving the problem?
    - Does that change your approach to the article?

<br />

# :memo: Writing to our Audience

- This blog's target audience is you. You are writing for yourself
- Be yourself, do not say anything in writing that you wouldn't say in conversation

- Beware of the ***curse of knowledge***:
    
    > <br />
    > A bias that occurs when an individual, who is communicating with other individuals, assumes that the other individuals have the background knowledge to understand.
    >
    > <br />

<br />

- You are the expert in your domain/topic. Wherever possible, simplify your language and provide background for your reader (in-text or hyperlinked).

<br />

# :dart: Structuring your blog post

## General tips:

- **Keywords:** It's good practice to incorporate keywords in your ```<h1>``` and other headers 

- **Headers:** Everyone's friend when reading online is the header; they divide the material, structure it, and let readers learn more when skimming

- **Short Paragraphs:** When online, large blocks of text create a barrier to engaging readers. You enable readers to skim and gather more information with brief paragraphs, on average 3 sentences, typically no more than five or six
    - Sentences (~ 25 words) 
    - Paragraphs (~ 3 sentences no more than 6)

- **Length:** Based on SEO metrics articles roughly 1500-2500 words tend to do best however this is a large word count and is not absolutely required. ***Tailor as needed.***
    
- **Hyperlinks:** By doing so, extraneous background information can be reduced while still enabling a wider audience to follow along.
