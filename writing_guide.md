<br />

**Hello all!**

The following guide is only meant to provide some clarity to how to approach your writing and is by no means prescriptive. 

In it you will find the information on following:

1. [Determining a topic](#thought_balloon-determining-a-topic)

2. [Writing to an audience](#memo-writing-to-an-audience)

3. [Structuring your blog post](#dart-structuring-your-blog-post)

    - [General tips](#general-tips)
    - [Problem Centered Template](#problem-centered-post)
    - [Wiki Template](#wiki-post)
    - [Conversational Template](#wiki-post)

<br />

# :thought_balloon: Determining a Topic

Three simple steps when stuck on ideas:

1. Start with your reader

    - What problems does your reader experience?
    - What questions are they asking? 

<br/>

2. Jot a list of everything that comes to mind

</br>

3. Pick and Google one of these problems and take note of the top three search results
    - How have these search results phrased the problem?
    - How are they solving the problem?
    - Does that change your approach to your article?

<br />

# :memo: Writing to our Audience

- This blog's target audience is you. You are writing for yourself
- Be yourself, do not say anything in writing that you wouldn't say in conversation

- Beware of the ***curse of knowledge***:
    
    > <br />
    > The curse of knowledge is a cognitive bias that occurs when an individual, who is communicating with other individuals, assumes that the other individuals have the background knowledge to understand. This bias is also called by some authors the curse of expertise.
    >
    > <br />
<br />

- You are the expert in your domain/topic. Wherever possible, simplify your language and provide background for your reader (in-text or hyperlinked).

<br />

# :dart: Structuring your blog post

## General tips:

- **Keywords:** It's good practice to incorporate keywords in your ```<h1>``` and other headers 

- **Headers:** Everyone's friend when reading online is the header; they divide the material, structure it, and let readers learn more when skimming

- **Short Paragraphs:** When online, large blocks of text create a barrier to engaging readers. You enable readers to skim and gather more information with brief paragraphs, on average 3 sentences, typically no more than five or six
    - Sentences (~ 25 words) 
    - Paragraphs (~ 3 sentences no more than 6)

- **Length:** Based on SEO metrics articles roughly 1500-2500 words tend to do best however this is a large word count and is not absolutely required. ***Tailor as needed.***
    
- **Hyperlinks:** By doing so, extraneous background information can be reduced while still enabling a wider audience to follow along.
