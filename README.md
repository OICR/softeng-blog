# :computer: Running a Local Instance

### **1. Clone this repo**

### **2. cd into the repo and run:**

```bash
gem install jekyll bundler
bundle install
sh serve.sh
```

# :ballot_box: Submitting a Blog Post

### **1. Setup a local up-to-date copy of the repository:**
```
git clone https://github.com/OICR/softeng-blog.git
cd softeng-blog
```

**(or) Pull recent changes:**
```
cd softeng-blog
git checkout gh-pages
git pull
```

### **2. Branch from gh-pages and push your branch to github.**

- This will create a new branch for your blog post and sync it with github
- Branch name can be your firstname_topic (for example: alexis_argo), branches can be deleted after merge

```
git checkout -b <branch>
git push -u origin <branch>
```

### **3. Start adding content into your user directory inside `/_posts/`, user directories are in the form `firstname_lastname`, if you are unsure about your username, please refer to `/_data/authors.yml`.**

- To be properly indexed, markdown files must contain the specific header, and the file name should start with its date (e.g. `_posts/sam_lee/2021-06-06-starting-up-from-scratch.md`)
- For multiple authors simply list authors separated by ", "

- We are using `kramdown` markdown converter. You can find out more about it here [kramdown](http://kramdown.gettalong.org). We highly recommend going through its syntax documentation
to get yourself more familiar with the coding style.
- Images can be added as an absolute or a relative link. You can look at kramdown syntax documentation to find out about adding absolute links. For a relative link images you can upload them into your folder inside images directory `/images/firstname_lastname/image.png`
    -  To refer them inside your blog post, use the image url from the site config as `{{ site.urlimg }}` and append relative link of your image. `{{ site.urlimg }}/firstname_lastname/image.png`

### **4. Sync your new branch with Github**

- At regular interval, push your content to Github.

```
git commit -a -m "Describe your changes"
git push
```

### **5. Create a Pull Request**

Once your content is ready for review, create a pull request from your new branch towards gh-pages.

# :arrow_up: Updating blog content

- Blog data (projects, team members, positions, ...) are located in `/_data/`, please edit those files in your own branch and submit pull requests towards gh-pages.
