# :runner: :dash: TL;DR

- Word counts can vary depending on the type of article but here's a general outline based on SEO metrics:
    - Sentences (~ 25 words) 
    - Paragraphs (~ 3 sentences no more than 6)
    - Articles (~ 1500-2500 words)
- Know your reader, what problems do they face, what questions are they asking?
- Provide appropriate background info and define key terms
- Use headers & hyperlinks (this can help cut on background information)
- Place keywords in ```<h1>``` 
- Try to target googles featured snippet box
    - As concisely and definitively as you can, share the definition of your main topic (one to two paragraphs) within your article.
- Try incorporating other forms of media
- If in doubt check out the [templates provided here](#templates) and the google doc template worksheets linked below:
    - [Problem Centered Template](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1BStxDjG_iGDc1m-pgOxnMNsh3e5oRmD4llS9DLe92k0/edit?usp=sharing)
    - [Wiki Template](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1BEra-ugD4ETTv_9WQNOwGhMBgry7yeYnW5TEzmDb7Bs/edit?usp=sharing)
    - [Conversational Template](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1_-hJgzEvtFbCwIfn6hrhhojI-mYaFZ-NJ0bWnDqExgM/edit?usp=sharing)

<br />

# :thought_balloon: Determining a Topic

Three simple steps when stuck on ideas:

1. Start with your reader

    - What problems does your reader experience?
    - What questions are they asking? 

<br/>

2. Jot a list of everything that comes to mind

</br>

3. Pick and Google one of these problems and take note of the top three search results
    - How have these search results phrased the problem?
    - How are they solving the problem?
    - Does that change your approach to your article?

<br />

# :memo: Writing to an Audience

When writing it's important to have a clear idea who your readers are. I made the following table to help you narrow in who your readership is when writing your article.

|Categories|Keywords|Description|
|---|---|---|
|Domain|Informatics, Software Engineering, Cloud Infrastructure etc.|This list is not exhaustive, any given article may cross multiple domains.|
|Intent|Inform, Describe, Convince|Why are you writing this article? Is it informative, descriptive, or argumentative?|
|Audience|General, Knowledgeable, Experts|For our purposes, assuming a general or knowledgeable audience is probably the best bet.<ul><li>General audience -> less or no assumptions, give extensive background information and define all key technical terms (hyperlinks can save word-count).</li><li>Knowledgeable audience -> cut down on background information and use common key terms without explanation (still good practice to hyperlink)</li><li>Expert audience -> no need for extensive background information. Use technical terms freely without definition</li></ul>|
|Formality|Informal, Neutral, Formal|This can depend on the structure/aim of your article. <ul><li>For a [wiki style post](#wiki-post) you will likely write more formally</li><li>For a [problem centered post](#problem-centered-post) you may chose a more neutral tone</li><li>For a [conversational post](#conversational-post) you may chose to be more informal</li></ul>|

<br />

# :dart: Structuring your blog post

## General tips:

- **Keywords:** It's good practice to incorporate keywords in your ```<h1>``` and other headers 

- **Headers:** Everyone's friend when reading online is the header; they divide the material, structure it, and let readers learn more when skimming

- **Short Paragraphs:** When online, large blocks of text create a barrier to engaging readers. You enable readers to skim and gather more information with brief paragraphs, on average 3 sentences, typically no more than five or six
    - Sentences (~ 25 words) 
    - Paragraphs (~ 3 sentences no more than 6)

- **Length:** Based on SEO metrics articles roughly 1500-2500 words tend to do best
    
- **Hyperlinks:** By doing so, extraneous background information can be reduced while still enabling a wider audience to follow along.

## :muscle: Templates

Here you'll find guided templates for three blog-post structures that should work for our type of content: 
- [The Problem Centered Post](#problem-centered-post)
- [the wiki post](#wiki-post)
- [the conversational post](#conversational-post)

<br />

-->

## Problem Centered Post

**Description** Present a problem that your reader is experiencing, empathize with that problem, and then solve the problem.

**Approximate word count:** 1500-2500 words. 

:memo: **Google Docs:** [Problem Centered Post Template](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1BStxDjG_iGDc1m-pgOxnMNsh3e5oRmD4llS9DLe92k0/edit?usp=sharing)

**Titles:** Information on creating a title can be found within the google doc. 

<!-- 
|Segments| Description |Approximate Length|
|---|---|---|
|Identify the problem|Engage the reader, Introduce the issue your reader is trying to solve and any potential situations in which it might occur.|1-3 Paragraphs*|
|Make the problem personal|Give a more thorough explanation of the problem by describing its consequences or, even better, by sharing your own experience. Instead of just giving facts, stir up some emotion. It becomes evident that you want them to succeed because you've experienced similar suffering; the blog becomes authentic.|2-5 Paragraphs|
|Tell how you discovered the solution|You are not yet providing a solution to your problem; rather, you are discussing how one person, possibly you, discovered the solution.|3-5 Paragraphs (maybe less)|
|Provide your solution|Solve the problem in a step by step guide.|Minimum 3 Paragraphs|
|Conclude & Provide a call to action|Finish your topic with some motivation and encouragement. Include any practical steps required to get going. This is also an excellent time to promote socials, next steps, downloadable content, or other related posts.|1-3 Paragraphs|
|End with a question|To make the blog interactive, it's good practice to finish with a reflective or thought-provoking question. Encourage the reader to follow up on this in the comments section.|1-2 lines|

<br />

-->

## Wiki Post

**Description:** Gain readers, establish your expertise on a subject, and help many people along the way. Content from wikis or encyclopedias, particularly material that Wikipedia hasn't covered, is also a huge benefit for gaining search traffic. Keep in mind this is still a blog post and not actually a Wikipedia article   

**Approximate word count:** 1500-2500 words. 

 :memo: **Google Docs:** [Wiki Post Template Linked Here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1BEra-ugD4ETTv_9WQNOwGhMBgry7yeYnW5TEzmDb7Bs/edit?usp=sharing)

 **Titles:** Information on creating a title can be found within the google doc. 

 <!--

|Segments| Description |Approximate Word Count|
|---|---|---|
|Introduction|Try not to start off by defining your topic; instead, introduce it your topic by talking about the reader's motivations for reading the post. You can ask yourself "why would someone look for information on this subject, what issues are they trying to solve, what is their unique context? Write down your responses and explain how you plan to resolve them in your article.|1-3 paragraphs|
|Define the topic*|As concisely and definitively as you can, share the definition for that topic.|1-2 paragraphs|
|Provide context on that topic|You may choose to explore: <ul><li>The history of the topic</li><li>Where the topic fits within a broader field</li><li>How readers might apply it to their own work or life</li><li>Review its effectiveness or compare/contrast it to other related elements)</li></ul>|5 or more paragraphs.|
|Provide specific examples|Provide one or two case studies to help illustrate your points and provide context (especially if the topic is more abstract). Making it personal can also give the content more authenticity and personality.|5 or more paragraphs|
|Provide step-by-step advice (optional)|Solve problems in a step by step guide or even link to other resources or posts.|5 or more paragraphs|
|Restate readers intent|Restate the reader's motivation for reading your article and discuss how you addressed those questions, solved those problems, and provided context. This is also an excellent time to promote socials, next steps, downloadable content, or other related posts.|2-5 paragraphs|
|End with a question|Pose a reflective or thought-provoking question to your reader. Encourage them to participate in the comments section.|1-2 lines|

**Try to stick to one to two paragraphs as the goal is to define your topic well enough so google can pull it as a featured snippet*

<br />

-->

## Conversational Post

**Description:** Spark engagement with readers by creating a thought provoking conversational piece.

**Approximate word count:** 1500 words. 

:memo: **Google Docs:** [Conversational Post Template](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1_-hJgzEvtFbCwIfn6hrhhojI-mYaFZ-NJ0bWnDqExgM/edit?usp=sharing)

**Titles:** Information on creating a title can be found within the google doc. 

<!--

|Segments| Description |Approximate Word Count|
|---|---|---|
|Introduction|The flow can be like a conversation you might have with a colleague, you may want to lead with a question. |1-2 lines|
|Perspective|State your position/outlook, then explain your reasoning. Telling a story about an experience you had can add novelty and authenticity.|2-4 Paragraphs (~100 to 200 words)|
|End with a question|Pose a reflective or thought-provoking question to your reader. Encourage them to participate in the comments section.|1-2 lines|

We are using `kramdown` markdown converter. You can find out more about it here [kramdown](http://kramdown.gettalong.org). We highly recommend going through its syntax documentation
to get yourself more familiar with the coding style.

#### Support for multiple authors

Simply list authors separated by ", "

```yml
---
author: firstname_lastname, firstname_lastname, firstname_lastname
---
```

##### Images

Images can be added as an absolute or a relative link. You can look at kramdown syntax documentation to find out about adding absolute links. For a relative link images you can upload them into your folder inside images directory `/images/firstname_lastname/image.png`

To refer them inside your blog post, use the image url from the site config as `{{ site.urlimg }}` and append relative link of your image. `{{ site.urlimg }}/firstname_lastname/image.png`

### Sync your new branch with Github

At regular interval, push your content to Github.

```
git commit -a -m "Describe your changes"
git push
```

### Create a Pull Request

Once your content is ready for review, create a pull request from your new branch towards gh-pages.

https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request/

### Update blog content (non-posts)

Blog data (projects, team members, positions, ...) are located in `/_data/`, please edit those files in your own branch and submit pull requests towards gh-pages.
